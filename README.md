# Booking Application
This application contains both backend and frontend code. 
It was created for a Biokineticist and is designed for clients to book appointments with the Biokineticist. The Biokineticist can then review and either accept or decline the appointments. 
Upon acceptance or decline, the client will be notified, and they can view their booking dates along with the status of acceptance or decline.
